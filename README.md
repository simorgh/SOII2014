###### Description

The overall objective of the project is to develop a (non-GUI) application which allows extracting and indexing the words
contained in multiple plain text files. All testing text files are provided as a project resources.

These text files are basically free English ebooks extracted from Gutenberg website (http://www.gutenberg.org/). Note that there are hundreds of these files. The application must read each of these text files, extract and index all words contained
(p1,p2). Once we got this information, data must be analyzed in order to display certain parts of the extracted information (p3).

Finally, we show the benefits of taking advantage of all of the performance enhancements available through division of work that concurrent programming offers (p4).
